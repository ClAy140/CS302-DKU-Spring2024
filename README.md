# **CS302 - Introduction to Computer Vision**

## **Course Overview**
The invention of the CCD camera in 1969 by Willard Boyle and George Smith revolutionized both science and society. Today, digital cameras are embedded in almost every device, from smartphones to industrial equipment. Beyond capturing images, cameras enable powerful tools such as face recognition, optical character recognition (OCR), panorama stitching, and augmented reality.

This course introduces the fundamental algorithms behind these applications, providing students with the theoretical foundation and hands-on experience necessary to implement computer vision techniques in Python.

## **Course Goals**
By the end of this course, students will:
- Understand the physical and mathematical principles of image acquisition.
- Identify problems that can be solved using computer vision techniques (e.g., panorama stitching, face recognition, depth estimation).
- Compare classical computer vision algorithms with neural network-based implementations to select the most appropriate solution.
- Implement key computer vision algorithms in Python and develop test cases for parameter tuning.
- Communicate findings effectively using **Jupyter Notebooks**.

## **Course Structure**
### **Class Format**
- **4 hours per week** of lectures and interactive activities, including:
  - Group discussions
  - Hands-on coding exercises
  - Q&A sessions
  - Quizzes
- **2 office hours per week** for additional discussions and support.
- **5 homework assignments** to assess progress.
- **A research presentation** (team-based) on a selected computer vision technique.
- **Final project** where students apply course concepts to a real-world problem of their choice.

### **Grading Breakdown**
| Activity | Points | Comments |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Homework | 45 | 5 assignments |
| Quizzes | 15 | Rescaled such that the top student gets full points |
| Research Presentation | 10 | Team-based presentation |
| Final Project | 30 | Individual or group project |

**Research Presentation**  
- Students will form teams of two and choose a topic from a provided list (Week 5).  
- Oral presentations (15 minutes) will be recorded and reviewed in Week 6.  

**Final Project**  
- Students will solve a real-world computer vision problem using Python.  
- They will collect and preprocess data, develop algorithms, and critically evaluate their results.  
- Final presentations (20 minutes + 10-minute discussion) will be held on **May 6**.

Grading for presentations and projects will be based on effort, critical thinking, creativity, clarity, and contribution to discussions.

## **Course Policies**
### **Grading & Academic Integrity**
- **Homework is individual work.** Sharing code or solutions is **not allowed**. Violations will result in a **zero grade** for all involved.
- **Homework Deadlines:** Assignments are released by Wednesday and due by **Sunday 24:00**.
- **Late Submission Penalty:**
  - -2 points for the first 24 hours.
  - Additional -2 points for every subsequent 24-hour delay.

### **Use of ChatGPT**
- You **may** use ChatGPT for homework and the final project **if** you **clearly acknowledge** which parts of your code were AI-generated.
- **Over-reliance on AI** without understanding the underlying concepts is discouraged.

### **Communication Channels**
- **Conceptual Questions:** Ask after class, attend office hours, or email in urgent cases.
- **WeChat Group:** Used for announcements and quick organizational queries.
- **Personal Matters:** Office hours are preferred. For urgent issues, email to schedule a Zoom meeting.
